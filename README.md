# Portfolio-Bjorn-Andersson

## Introduction

I am Björn Andersson, an eager student at ITHS Göteborg studying to become a JavaScript developer. I have loved every second of studying JavaScript and look forward to develop a career in this field, LIA this coming fall is my next step in doing so.

In everything I do I strive to do my outmost and my very best, this include coding. I love discovering new ways of doing things and JavaScript and all the other languages necessary for a complete front-end allows me to pour myself into them and learn something new every day. 

In this portfolio you will see my projects that I have programmed for my JavaScript classes. Most was done by myself on my own, except for the 3rd project, Deg - a budget calculator, which was done with 5 other classmates.
